# Chapter 1 - The Power of Thought

## The man who thought his way into partnership with Thomas Edison
Edwin Barnes wanted to work with Thomas Edison, but he did not know Edison, he had little education, he had no influence and did not have enough money for the rail. These would have discouraged most people but he turned his desires into reality. He traveled on a freight train and met Edison with an expression of determination and that landed him in Edison's office. His determination and persistence with a single desire was destined to mow down all opposition and bring him the opportunity he was seeking for, "I came here to go into business with Edison, and I'll accomplish this if it takes the remainder of my life". Opportunity came after Edison invented a new device, the Edison Dictating Machine (first version of telephone). Salesmen were not enthusiastic, but Barnes knew he could sell it, and it was so successful that Edison allow him to distribute it. "Made by Edison, installed by Barnes", his desires have brought him riches, knowledge, and partnership.



# Faith

Auto-suggestion is the transmutation of desire into its physical equivalent. Faith is a state of mind which may be induced or created to the subconscious mind through the principle of auto-suggestion.

you may convince the subconscious mind that you believe you will receive that for which you ask, and it will act upon the belief, which your subconscious mind passes back to you in the form of faith, followed by definite plans for procuring that which you desire.

Repetition of affirmation of order to your subconscious mind is the only known method of voluntary development of the emotion of faith.

Impulse of thought which is repeatedly passed on to the subconscious mind is finally accepted and acted upon by the subconscious mind, which translate that Impulse into its physical equivalent by the most practical procedure available.

A thought Impulse of negative or destructive nature just as readily as it will act upon by the subconscious mind

Conduct yourself just as you would if you were already possession of the material thing which you are demanding, when you call upon your subconscious mind.
