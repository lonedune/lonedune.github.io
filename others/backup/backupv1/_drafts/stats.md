# Sample has to be randomness and representativeness
randomness - a random sample is collected when each member of the sample is chosen from the population strictly by chance
representativeness - a representative sample is a subset of the population that accurately  reflects the members of the entire population

# Types of Data
Categorical
Numerical - Discrete and Continuous

## Categorical
- Brand names
- 'Yes' or 'No'
- Scale of 1 to 5
- Gender

## Discrete
- Number of objects
- SAT score

## Continuous
- Area
- Height
- Time

# Measurement Levels
- Qualitative - Nominal, Ordinal
- Quantitative - Interval, Ratio

## Nominal
Categorical values that cannot be ordered
E.g. brand names

## Ordinal
Categorical values that can be ordered
E.g. Scale from bad to good

## Interval
Does not have a true 0 (zero)
E.g. Temperature in celsius fahrenheit

## Ratio
Has a true 0 (zero)
E.g. Number of objects, distance, time

# Visualising Data
Categorical - Bar charts, pie charts, pareto diagram
Numerical - Histogram
Relationship between 2 variables - Side-by-side bar chart (categorical), scatter plot (numerical)

# Measures of central tendency
## Mean
Simple average
Adding up all the components and divide by the number of components
Will be affected by outliers

## Median
Middle number in an ordered dataset
The value at position (n+1)/2 in the ordered list
If position is middle of 2 indexes, get average of the 2 values

## Mode
Value that occurs the most often
Get the highest frequency value

# Skewness
Whether the dataset is concentrated on one side
Right/positive skew - most data are concentrated on the left, and outlier are on the right

# Variability
## Variance
Variance measures the dispersion of a set of data points around their mean value

## Standard deviation
Square root of Variance

## Coefficient of Variation
Standard deviation relative to the mean
Standard deviation divide by the mean
Useful to check if 2 datasets have the same variability

## Covariance
To calculate correlation between 2 variables. Covariance gives a sense of direction where the 2 variables are moving. If covariance > 0, the 2 variables move together. Covariance < 0, the 2 variables move in opposite directions. Covariance = 0, the 2 variables are independent.

## Linear correlation coefficient
Correlation coefficient is between -1 to 1. '1' means the entire variability of one variable is explained by the other.
Common practice is to disregard correlations between -0.2 to 0.2.

# Inferential Statistics

## Distributions
A distribution is a function that shows the possible values for a variable and how often they occur.
- Normal
- Binomial
- Uniform

### Discrete distribution
Rolling a die - is a discrete uniform distribution, all values have equal chance of occurring.
Rolling 2 dice - probability of rolling a 2 is 0.03, but probability rolling a 7 is 0.17.

### Standardisation
Standardisation makes predictions and inference better.

# Estimator
- point estimates (in the middle of confidence interval estimates)
- confidence interval estimates (provide more information and preferred)
